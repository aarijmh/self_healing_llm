# Banking Agent with MCP Integration

## Overview

A secure LLM-powered mobile agent that enables natural language banking and e-commerce transactions through Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Mobile Agent**: On-device LLM with CallSign authentication
- **Bank MCP Server**: Secure banking operations with CNP protocol
- **E-commerce MCP Servers**: Product search and ordering (Amazon, etc.)
- **Authentication Layer**: CallSign biometric security
- **Payment Protocol Bridge**: Google Agent Payment Protocol integration

### System Flow

```
User → Mobile Agent → CallSign Auth → Payment Protocol → MCP Servers → Transaction Execution
```

### Agent-to-Agent Payment Flow

```
Bank Agent ↔ Google Payment Protocol ↔ Merchant Agent ↔ E-commerce Platform
```

## Authentication Flow

### Initial Setup
1. User downloads bank's mobile app
2. CallSign SDK performs device fingerprinting
3. Biometric enrollment (face, voice, behavior)
4. Bank validates identity and issues device certificate
5. Agent receives encrypted credentials and MCP endpoints

### Runtime Authentication
```
User Request
    ↓
CallSign Biometric Validation
    ↓
Device Certificate Verification
    ↓
MCP Token Generation (15min TTL)
    ↓

```

### Security Features
- Hardware security module integration
- Encrypted credential storage in secure enclave
- Step-up authentication for high-value transactions
- Automatic session invalidation on anomalies
