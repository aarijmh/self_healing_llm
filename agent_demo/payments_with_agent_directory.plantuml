entity "CallSign Agent Gateway" as Directory

== Phase 1: Merchant Registration with Agent Directory ==

Merchant -> Directory : Register merchant identity
Directory -> Directory : Verify merchant credentials (business license, domain ownership)
Directory -> Directory : Generate merchant certificate & signing key
Directory -> Merchant : **Merchant authenticated & registered**
note right: Merchant can now issue agents\nwith Directory's blessing

== Phase 2: Agent Registration & Signing ==

Merchant -> Agent : Develop agent with capabilities (shopping, checkout)
Merchant -> Directory : Register agent (agent_id, capabilities, scopes)
Directory -> Directory : Validate agent metadata & merchant signature
Directory -> Directory : Sign agent with Directory's private key
Directory -> Merchant : **Agent certificate (dual-signed: Merchant + Directory)**
note right: Agent certificate contains:\n- Agent ID\n- Merchant ID\n- Capabilities (payment, search, checkout)\n- Expiration date\n- Revocation endpoint

Merchant -> Merchant : Package agent with certificate into mobile app

== Phase 3: User Downloads App & CallSign Establishes Trust ==

Customer -> Merchant : Download Amazon app (includes signed agent)
Merchant -> Customer : Install app with embedded agent certificate

Customer -> Agent : Launch app & initiate setup
Agent -> Customer : Request authentication
Customer -> Agent : Provide credentials/biometrics

note over Agent, Directory: **CallSign Trust Establishment Process**

Agent -> Directory : Verify agent certificate is still valid
Directory -> Directory : Check certificate status & revocation list
Directory -> Agent : Certificate valid ✓
note right: CallSign confirms agent\nis legitimate & not revoked

Agent -> SDK : Initialize with agent certificate
SDK -> Directory : Validate agent signature chain (Directory → Merchant → Agent)
Directory -> Directory : Verify dual signatures (Directory + Merchant)
Directory -> SDK : Agent authenticity confirmed ✓
note right: CallSign cryptographically\nverifies agent identity

SDK -> Delegation : Register user-agent binding with certificate
Delegation -> Delegation : Create user-agent trust relationship
Delegation -> Directory : Verify agent capabilities & permissions
Directory -> Delegation : Agent capabilities validated ✓
Delegation -> SDK : User-agent binding established
SDK -> Agent : Store trust token & agent certificate
note right: CallSign creates secure\nUser ↔ Agent binding

Agent -> Customer : **Trust established via CallSign**
note over Customer, Agent: CallSign guarantees:\n1. Agent is authentic (signed by Directory)\n2. Agent is authorized by Merchant\n3. Agent has not been revoked\n4. Secure User-Agent binding created

Customer -> Agent : "Delegate shopping decisions (limit: $5000)"
Agent -> Delegation : Request delegation scope with user consent
Delegation -> Directory : Verify agent capabilities allow delegation
Directory -> Delegation : Capabilities confirmed (shopping, checkout) ✓
Delegation -> Delegation : Create delegation policy (limit: $5000)
Delegation -> Agent : Delegation granted with spending limits
Agent -> Customer : **Delegation active - I can shop on your behalf**
note right: CallSign enforces delegation\nlimits & monitors agent actions

== Phase 4: Automated Shopping Transaction ==

Customer -> Agent : "Buy me a laptop under $2000"
Agent -> Agent : Parse intent & verify delegation authority
Agent -> Directory : Validate session & agent certificate
Directory -> Agent : Session valid, certificate not revoked

Agent -> Agent : Search product catalog
Agent -> Agent : Find Dell XPS 15 ($1,899)
Agent -> Customer : "Found Dell XPS 15 for $1,899. Proceeding with purchase."

Agent -> Checkout : Navigate to checkout (automated)
Checkout -> Gateway : Transaction request with agent certificate
Gateway -> Gateway : Detect AI agent via certificate
Gateway -> Directory : Verify agent certificate authenticity
Directory -> Gateway : Certificate valid, merchant trusted

Gateway -> Gateway : Enhanced verification (agent-specific rules)
Gateway -> Gateway : Check delegation limits ($1,899 < $5,000 ✓)
Gateway -> Gateway : Behavioral analysis (agent pattern recognition)

alt Agent Certificate Valid & Within Limits
    Gateway -> Customer : Step-up authentication (biometric)
    Customer -> Gateway : Face scan confirmation
    Gateway -> Gateway : Authorization decision
    Gateway -> Checkout : Proceed with transaction
else Certificate Revoked or Limits Exceeded
    Gateway -> Agent : Transaction blocked
    Agent -> Customer : "Cannot complete - requires manual approval"
end

Checkout -> PaymentProtocol : Request payment authorization with agent attestation
PaymentProtocol -> Bank : Authorize payment (agent certificate included)
Bank -> Bank : Verify agent certificate from Directory
Bank -> Bank : Validate delegation authority
Bank -> PaymentProtocol : Confirm authorization
PaymentProtocol -> Backend : Store token with agent binding
Backend -> PaymentProtocol : Token stored
Agent -> Customer : **Payment successful - Order placed automatically**

== Phase 5: Subsequent Automated Transaction (30 Days Later) ==

Customer -> Agent : "Buy wireless mouse under $100"
Agent -> Agent : Verify delegation still active
Agent -> Directory : Validate agent certificate & check revocation
Directory -> Agent : Certificate valid

Agent -> SDK : Validate trust chain
SDK -> Delegation : Verify user-agent binding
Delegation -> Directory : Confirm agent certificate status
Directory -> Delegation : Agent trusted
Delegation -> SDK : Trust confirmed

Agent -> Agent : Search & find Logitech MX Master ($99)
Agent -> Checkout : Automated checkout

SDK -> Backend : Retrieve stored token with agent certificate
Backend -> Backend : Verify agent certificate signature
Backend -> SDK : Token returned with trust validation

Gateway -> Gateway : AI agent detection via certificate
Gateway -> Gateway : Enhanced verification
Gateway -> Gateway : Check velocity limits & delegation scope

alt Token Valid & Within Delegation Limits
    Gateway -> Gateway : Authorization approved (no step-up needed)
    Agent -> PaymentProtocol : Use token to initiate payment
    PaymentProtocol -> Bank : Process payment with agent attestation
    Bank -> Bank : Validate agent certificate from Directory
    Bank -> PaymentProtocol : Confirm payment
    PaymentProtocol -> Agent : Payment success
    Agent -> Customer : **Mouse ordered automatically - No interaction needed!**
else Security Threshold Exceeded
    Gateway -> Customer : Step-up authentication required
    Customer -> Gateway : Biometric confirmation
end

== Phase 6: Agent Revocation Scenario ==

note over Directory: Security incident detected:\nAgent vulnerability discovered

Directory -> Directory : Revoke agent certificate
Directory -> Directory : Update revocation list
Directory -> Merchant : Notify of revocation
Directory -> Bank : Broadcast revocation to payment network

Customer -> Agent : "Buy headphones"
Agent -> Directory : Validate certificate
Directory -> Agent : **Certificate REVOKED**
Agent -> Customer : "Agent disabled - Please update app"
Agent -> Agent : Disable all payment capabilities
