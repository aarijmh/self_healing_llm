---

### Part 1: System Architecture (3 minutes)

**Navigate to Entity Dashboard**

Point to each entity and explain:

1. **CallSign Auth** (Blue)
   > "Our biometric authentication partner - handles face, voice, and behavioral authentication"

2. **Bank MCP Server** (Purple)
   > "The brain of our system - coordinates all agent activities and maintains security"

3. **HSM** (Green)
   > "Hardware Security Module - generates cryptographic tokens with military-grade security"

4. **Bank Core** (Yellow)
   > "Your existing banking infrastructure - we integrate seamlessly"

5. **Merchant MCPs** (Orange)
   > "Amazon, BestBuy, Target - we search across multiple retailers for best deals"

6. **Payment Protocol** (Red)
   > "Google's secure payment protocol - enables trusted agent-to-agent transactions"

**Key Message:**
> "Notice how all these systems work together seamlessly. The user sees a simple interface, but behind the scenes, we're orchestrating complex security and payment protocols."

---

### Part 2: Live Demonstration (10 minutes)

#### Demo Flow 1: Setup & Registration (3 minutes)

**Click "1. Setup & Registration"**

**Narration while demo runs:**

> "Watch as we simulate a new user downloading our app. First, we verify their identity through your existing KYC systems..."

*Point to Process Flow panel as steps appear*

> "Now we're registering their device and enrolling biometrics. Notice the CallSign entity lighting up - that's real-time biometric processing."

> "Finally, we're registering the AI agent with the Bank MCP server. The HSM generates dual-signed certificates - one from the bank, one from the agent. This is crucial for merchant trust."

**Highlight in Results Panel:**
- Agent ID generated
- Registered MCP endpoints (Amazon, BestBuy, Target)
- Security certificates

**Key Takeaway:**
> "In under 2 minutes, we've created a fully authenticated, bank-verified AI agent with shopping capabilities."

---

#### Demo Flow 2: Delegation (2 minutes)

**Click "2. Delegate Authority"**

**Narration:**

> "Now the user delegates shopping authority to the agent. This is where it gets interesting..."

> "Notice the enhanced authentication - we require biometric confirmation plus PIN. The user is giving the agent permission to spend up to $5,000 on electronics and home goods."

**Point to Results:**
- Delegation ID
- Spending limits: $5,000
- Categories: electronics, home

**Key Takeaway:**
> "The user maintains complete control. They set limits, categories, and can revoke delegation anytime. The agent can't exceed these boundaries."

---

#### Demo Flow 3: Purchase Execution (5 minutes)

**Click "3. Execute Purchase"**

**Narration:**

> "Let's say the user needs a laptop for work, budget under $2,000. Watch what happens..."

**As steps execute, highlight:**

1. **Authentication** (Step 1)
   > "First, continuous biometric authentication - ensuring it's really the user"

2. **Multi-Shopper Search** (Steps 2-4)
   > "Now here's the magic - we're simultaneously searching Amazon, BestBuy, and Target. Look at the products appearing..."

   *Point to Products Section*
   
   > "Dell XPS from Amazon at $1,899, MacBook Air from BestBuy at $1,799, HP Spectre from Target at $1,699. The agent analyzes all options and recommends the MacBook based on work needs and value."

3. **Transaction Authorization** (Step 5)
   > "Before any money moves, we check spending limits and fraud rules. Notice the authorization is approved within milliseconds."

4. **Payment Authentication** (Step 6)
   > "Step-up authentication - the user confirms the payment with another biometric scan. Security at every step."

5. **Payment Token Generation** (Step 7)
   > "The HSM generates a time-limited payment token - only valid for 5 minutes. Even if intercepted, it's useless after expiry."

6. **Payment Processing** (Step 8)
   > "Here's where the bank trust matters. Because this payment comes from a bank-verified agent, BestBuy accepts it with higher confidence. This enables..."

7. **Order Creation** (Step 9)
   > "...expedited processing! Look at the order confirmation - 'bank-verified payment' means faster fulfillment. Delivery tomorrow instead of 3-5 days."

**Point to Transaction Summary:**
> "And there it is - purchase complete, order confirmed, new balance updated. The entire flow took less than 10 seconds."

## 🎯 Handling Questions

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What if the user's phone is stolen?**
> "Great question. The agent requires continuous biometric authentication. Without the user's face/voice, the thief can't access the agent. Plus, the user can remotely revoke delegation from any device."

**Q: How do you prevent the agent from overspending?**
> "Multiple safeguards: spending limits set by the user, category restrictions, real-time fraud monitoring, and every transaction requires user confirmation. The agent can search and recommend, but the user always approves."

**Q: What about privacy? Does the agent see my bank balance?**
> "The agent only sees what it needs to complete transactions. It doesn't have access to your full account history or personal data. All communication is encrypted and logged for audit."

**Q: How does this integrate with existing banking systems?**
> "We use standard banking APIs and protocols. The Bank MCP server acts as a secure gateway to your core banking system. No changes to your existing infrastructure required."

**Q: What's the implementation timeline?**
> "Typically 3-6 months depending on integration complexity. We handle the heavy lifting - you provide API access to your core systems."

**Q: What's the cost model?**
> "We offer flexible pricing: per-transaction fees, monthly subscription, or revenue sharing. The ROI is typically positive within 6 months due to increased transaction volume."
